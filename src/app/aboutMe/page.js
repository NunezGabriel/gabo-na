            Hi. I'm Gabriel
          </h1>
          <p className="max-w-300px">
            I'm a software developer with a strong passion for technology and
            innovation, and I will soon be a software engineer. I specialize in
            web development technologies, both frontend and backend, skills that
            you can explore in the Skills section. When programming, I focus on
            implementing best practices, creating code that is scalable and easy
            to maintain.As for my social skills, punctuality has characterized
            me since I was young, something I learned from my family. I'm a
            sociable person and enjoy working in teams, as I firmly believe in
            the value of mutual growth: I like to share my knowledge and learn
            from others. Additionally, I am open-minded, always respecting
            everyoneâ€™s tastes and opinions.
